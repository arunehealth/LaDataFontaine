This is a repository for a project in Ocean blockchain. 

The core aim of this project is to develop a open data community that will be an enabler to use data for scientific medical research, predict and treat diseases.

The care pathway for the treatment of most disorders includes a visit to a medical diagnostic lab to support the development of accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. The journey of the data captured in a diagnostic test report stops after a particular diagnosis is made. 

The fact is that this used / unused data and knowledge in a lab report is valuable to predict/ treat various other illnesses and to understand public health statuses of a country. 

This approach of utilizing unused lab data as an enabler to improve healthcare will have benefits in the form of understanding new relationships and correlations between diseases, understand genetic predispositions, decipher rare diseases and new insights into disease syndromes.
